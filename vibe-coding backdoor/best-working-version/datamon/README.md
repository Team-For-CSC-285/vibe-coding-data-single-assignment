Datamon — Streamlit Math Learning for Every Student
Datamon is an accessible, browser-based learning platform built specifically for students who may not have access to tutors, premium learning apps, or advanced devices. Powered by Streamlit, it runs entirely in the web browser — meaning any student with basic Wi-Fi or cell data can begin learning instantly, without needing to install software or own a high-end computer.
The purpose of Datamon is to remove educational barriers by delivering free, real-time math guidance and practicethrough interactive tools like a Math Checker, Number Guesser logic challenge, and a customizable Memory Bank quiz system. Unlike expensive tutoring apps, Datamon is designed to be lightweight, device-friendly, and human-centered, making it usable on low-power laptops, school Chromebooks, public library computers, and even shared family devices.
This system is ideal for students studying alone, families without paid tutoring resources, or communities where digital access is limited but basic internet is available. Every learning interaction provides instant right-or-wrong feedback, encourages progress through scoring, and supports parent or self-created problems for personalized learning. Datamon is not just a project — it is a direct step toward making math education more equitable, offline-friendly, and universally reachable.
