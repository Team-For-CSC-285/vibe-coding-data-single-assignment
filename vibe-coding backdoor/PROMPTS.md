This file explains how I used AI step-by-step during the Datamon project. I started simple and built up from there, making adjustments, debugging, and giving new instructions to guide the AI in the right direction. These are the main development prompts and what I learned from each.Prompt 1: Basic math practice game (terminal)I asked the AI to help me make a simple math practice game in Python where a user answers math problems and gets feedback. It generated a basic quiz that worked in the terminal using input and score tracking. It wasn't fully structured yet, but it ran and gave me something to build from. This taught me to start with something working, even if it's small.Prompt 2: Modularizing into classes and functionsOnce the first version worked, I asked AI to turn it into a more organized and expandable project. That included breaking the game into classes and functions for different modes like math checker, memory bank, and number guesser. The AI did a good job creating a structure, but I still needed to fix certain parts and understand the logic myself. This process showed me the value of modular code, especially for making future features possible.Prompt 3: Division with remainder supportI asked the AI to add division problems that require a quotient and remainder. It added the right math logic, including validation and second-chance attempts. This made the game feel more educational and realistic, especially for practicing long-division type math.Prompt 4: Turning the project into a Streamlit websiteTo make Datamon accessible online, I told the AI to convert the terminal version into a Streamlit web app. The AI created buttons, screens, and session state for scorekeeping. It worked, but I had to debug some session behavior. This taught me how different event-driven web apps are compared to command-line loops.Prompt 5: Accessibility focusI asked the AI to help me rewrite the purpose of the program to show that this is a learning tool meant for students who may not have tutors or expensive learning platforms. The AI helped me express that the goal is to give anyone with basic internet access a way to practice math and improve at their own pace.Overall lessons from promptingBeing specific makes AI output much better. It can build fast “skeletons” for code, but it still takes real problem-solving to debug, correct logic, and make sure the program works the way I intend it to. AI is a tool, not a replacement for understanding.
