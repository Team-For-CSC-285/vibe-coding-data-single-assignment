Throughout this project, I learned a lot about working with AI as a partner in the programming process. I was responsible for directing the work, understanding the decisions, and debugging when things didn’t behave the way they should. The AI was great for getting me started quickly and helping me think through the structure of the program, especially when breaking things into pieces for modular design or switching from terminal to web-based Streamlit.Building the Streamlit version helped me understand how event-driven programs work and how session state affects user interactions. It was different from regular command line programs, and at first things didn’t update correctly until I adjusted the state logic. That challenge helped me understand web logic better and gave me confidence in debugging real-world issues.I also reached moments where AI alone wasn’t enough. Sometimes the program “looked” right on the surface, but it still wasn’t functioning correctly. That made me step in and really think through variables, flow, and cause and effect in the program. That was an important learning moment, because it showed that AI can speed up coding but doesn’t replace true understanding.This project also made me think about accessibility. Not every student has access to tutors or paid learning tools. I wanted Datamon to be something someone could use as long as they have a basic internet connection or shared computer at school or a public place. Being able to help others learn like that is something that motivates me moving forward.In the future, I want to explore adding save features so students can track their progress over time, along with maybe a difficulty system or even a multiplayer rotation for practice groups. This experience made me more confident in using AI as a helper, but also proved to me that problem-solving skills and understanding still matter the most.
